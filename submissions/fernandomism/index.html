				<p>
					Basil is actually my fiancee's pet. We have a love/hate relationship. He's not blue - he doesn't collect rings. He just kind of deficates everywhere and eats. Also he likes to run in his wheel in the dark throughout the night.

						Contrary to popular belief they are not cuddly, poop everywhere, and are not very social animals.
