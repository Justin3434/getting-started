        <h4>Beginings</h4>
        <p>
            I've been biking since I was a kid, but perhaps I should draw a 
            line somewhere else for the begining of my story. I bought my first
            bicycle as an adult in the summer of 2002.  It was not only my first
            bicycle since my old Huffy Mountainstorm, but it has been the only
            new bicycle I've bought to date except a new frame and fork I bought
            last year.  This bicycle was a Haro V3 mountain bike, and this...
            is the begining.   
        </p>
        <h4>Commuting</h4>
        <p>
            When I first started bicycling as an adult I rode mostly off road or
            the <a href = "http://www.mcttrails.org/">bicyle trails in madison 
            county. </a> I put a reasonable amount of miles, and a lot of mud 
            on that old Haro.
