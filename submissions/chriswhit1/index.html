                <article>I got accepted to an agriculture program in France</article>
                    <p>I was the only one that signed up to do the program in my college.  I had to take the plane by myself.
                        I was very nervous.  When I got off the plane in a new country I took a deep breath and was able to find my way</p>
                    <p>I went to many tourist sites and visited many farm.  I made a lot of friends and will always cheerish that

                <article>I went with a student and a couple professors to Hiroshima, Japan</article>
                    <p>Since I was the only one in my agriculture department that went to France, I was given an opportunity to go to Japan
                    and mingle with some agriculture students</p>

                    <p>Japan was beautiful and I loved the food.  Everyone was very nice and we built a good relationship with a super science high school.</p>
                    <p>The goal of the trip was to establish a relationship to promote exchanging students.</p>
