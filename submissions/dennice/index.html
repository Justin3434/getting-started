					<h2>Kud</h2>
					<p>Two years ago, Kud followed my boyfriend into his apartment. We thought he was a girl because he didn't have balls. Turns out he was part of a catch and release,a nd wasn't chipped, so we kept him. He proceeded to infest the apartment with fleas and knock anything with liquic over. Today, he stomps on my head and barks in my ear in the mornings so I will let him hang out outside to bark at birds he can't catch. I love him, he's my buddy.</p>

					<h2>Flicka</h2>
					<p>Flicka was brought to me by a coworker as a little baby kitten with her brother, <a href="#pojke">Pojke</a>. She talks a lot, and we have conversations on the toilet. She licks my fingers then rubs her hear on them. She doesn't like to be picked up. If you pick her up, she screams like a dying cat, and all the other cats come to watch.</p>

					<h2>Pojke</h2>
					<p>Pojke is <a href="#flicka">Flicka</a>'s brother. He wants to be a big ol fatty. He eats and eats and eats and then rolls over for us to rub his belly. When I come home he waits at the tops of the stairs looking like a little gremlin.</p>

						<h4>Samosa</h4>
						<p>Samosa was a cross-eyed cat. My ex and I got him and his sister, Spaulding, from Tenth Life when we were together. We always said that if we broke up, I get Samosa, and he got Spaulding. One day Samosa never came home. My ex and i broke up shortly thereafter. Black cat curse?</p>
