                        Caption: Shibuya Square. This is probably the busiest
                        intersection in the world. It was memorable just
                        crossing the street with everyone else.

                        Caption: Street food. I had a lot of street food in Japan, and the Takoyaki
                        stands were some of my favorites. Takoyaki is basically
                        just squid, sauce and deep-fried batter.

                        Caption: Hachiko Statue. Hachiko was a dog remembered in
                        Japan for his loyalty. Hachiko would meet his owner on his
                        way home from work everyday at Shibuya station, and
                        after his owner died Hachiko continued to show up at
                        the same time each day for the next ten years.
