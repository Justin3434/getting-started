            <h2>The Team</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scolipede
                        <p><img src="file:///C:/Users/Mary/coding-class/gitprojects/html-me-something/submissions/NiceCrocs/images/scolipede.png"/></p>
                        <h4>Moves</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Megahorn</li>
                                <li>Earthquake</li>
                                <li>Swords Dance</li>
                                <li>Baton Pass</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>Item:</b> Focus Sash</p>
                            <p><b>Ability:</b> Speed Boost</p>
                            <p><b>Nature</b> Jolly</p>
                            <p><b>EVs:</b> 252 Attack / 252 Speed / 4 Defense</p>
                            <p><b>Strategy:</b> Due to its naturally high speed combined with it's Speed Boost ability, Scolipede can outmaneuver most opponents within one turn. A speedy Earthquake can ruin many attempts to set up Spikes or Stat changes, and after two turns of Speed Boost and Swords Dance, Scolipede is ready to Baton Pass to your chosen sweeper.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Pachirisu
                        <p><img src="file:///C:/Users/Mary/coding-class/gitprojects/html-me-something/submissions/NiceCrocs/images/pachirisu.png"/></p>
                        <h4>Moves</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>U-Turn</li>
                                <li>Nuzzle</li>
                                <li>Toxic</li>
                                <li>Super Fang</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>Item:</b> Sitrus Berry</p>
                            <p><b>Ability:</b> Volt Absorb</p>
                            <p><b>Nature</b> Impish</p>
                            <p><b>EVs:</b> 252 HP / 252 Defense / 4 Special Defense</p>
                            <p><b>Strategy:</b> Move over, Pikachu! This fiesty electric rodent caused a huge upset during the 2014 VGC World Championships, when it was used to great effect in the Masters Division by Korean Pok&#233;mon Master Se Jun Park. Pachirisu's claim to fame is it's ability to spread around the status with its Paralyzing Nuzzle and Poisoning Toxic. It's Leftovers and Volt Absorb keep its health topped-up, and when it gets in over its head, it U-Turns out of there!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Ferrothorn
                        <p><img src="file:///C:/Users/Mary/coding-class/gitprojects/html-me-something/submissions/NiceCrocs/images/ferrothorn.png"/></p>
                        <h4>Moves</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Stealth Rock</li>
                                <li>Spikes</li>
                                <li>Gyro Ball</li>
                                <li>Thunder Wave</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>Item:</b> Rocky Helmet</p>
                            <p><b>Ability:</b> Iron Barbs</p>
                            <p><b>Nature</b> Relaxed</p>
                            <p><b>EVs:</b> 252 HP / 192 Special Defense / 64 Defense</p>
                            <p><b>Strategy:</b> Thanks to Ferrothorn's bulk and typing, it is a reliable way to get Spikes and Stealth Rock set to trip up your enemies. Gyro Ball takes advantage of its rock-bottom Speed stat by dishing out massive damage, and is a useful way to handle Fairy-types and faster Pok&#233;mon. Be careful though! Ferrothorn's Steel/Grass typing gives it a 4x weakness to fire, so watch those sweepers!</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>Flygon
                        <p><img src="file:///C:/Users/Mary/coding-class/gitprojects/html-me-something/submissions/NiceCrocs/images/flygon.png"/></p>
                        <h4>Moves</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Draco Meteor</li>
                                <li>Earth Power</li>
                                <li>Defog</li>
                                <li>Fire Blast</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>Item:</b> Life Orb</p>
                            <p><b>Ability:</b> Levitate</p>
                            <p><b>Nature</b> Timid</p>
                            <p><b>EVs:</b> 252 Special Attack / 252 Speed / 4 Defense</p>
                            <p><b>Strategy:</b> Fairies in the Metagame doesnt mean this Dragon is down and out! Although Flygon's Special Attack is mediocre, Draco Meteor's massive base damage makes up for it. Add in Flygon's wide variety of different move types and ability to sweep away entry hazards and you have yourself a handy little Special Sweeper!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Snorlax
                        <p><img src="file:///C:/Users/Mary/coding-class/gitprojects/html-me-something/submissions/NiceCrocs/images/snorlax.png"/></p>
                        <h4>Moves</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Earthquake</li>
                                <li>Return</li>
                                <li>Rest</li>
                                <li>Sleep Talk</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>Item:</b> Leftovers</p>
                            <p><b>Ability:</b> Thick Fat</p>
                            <p><b>Nature</b> Careful</p>
                            <p><b>EVs:</b> 252 HP / 252 Defense / 4 Special Defense</p>
                            <p><b>Strategy:</b> Six generations later, and this Gen 1 titan is still in the running! Snorlax's sky-high HP and decent Defense stats, upkept by Rest and Leftovers, mean even the hardest-hitting sweeper moves will bounce right off his big belly. Sleep Talk ensures that even while napping, Snorlax is a beast to be reckoned with.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Mega Scizor
                        <p><img src="file:///C:/Users/Mary/coding-class/gitprojects/html-me-something/submissions/NiceCrocs/images/scizor-mega.png"/></p>
                        <h4>Moves</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Bullet Punch</li>
                                <li>X-Scissor</li>
                                <li>Swords Dance</li>
                                <li>Baton Pass</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>Item:</b> Scizorite</p>
                            <p><b>Ability:</b> Technician</p>
                            <p><b>Nature</b> Adamant</p>
                            <p><b>EVs:</b> 252 HP / 252 Attack / 4 Special Defense</p>
                            <p><b>Strategy:</b> Mega Scizor is a beast due to its through the roof Attack and Defense stats. Technician and Swords Dance alow it to bulk up even further before unleasing those devastating STAB moves of Bullet Punch and X-Scissor. When it's done, it can even pass off its stat bonuses to it teammates with a Baton Pass!</p>
