                <h2>PART I: Volge</h2>
                <p>
                    <img src="img_placeholder.jpeg"/><br>
                    In the gentle swirls of the river Epsilon, Volge floats in reverie.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="img_placeholder.jpeg"/><br>
                    Suddenly, he is rudely woken up by a dark figure towering above him - "Get out," it shrieked, "you are not dead yet!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="img_placeholder.jpeg"/><br>
                    Volge finds his way back ashore, and trudges through a quiet jungle littered with lightbulbs. He collects an armful of them as if they were fruits.
                </p>                
                <p>
                    <img src="img_placeholder.jpeg"/><br>
                    Volge selects one and eats it. Ichor spills out of his mouth as he chews thoughtfully. "I suppose I shall go for another swim now," he said to nobody in particular.

                <h2>PART II: Ande</h2>
                <p>
                    <img src="img_placeholder.jpeg"/><br>
                    Ande is quite fond of Shadows: he likes them so much that he drinks one for breakfast every morning and never grows tired of it.
                </p>   
                <p>
                    <img src="img_placeholder.jpeg"/><br>
                    One day, the Shapes in Ande's favourite Shadow Lamp escaped. Out the window they went!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="img_placeholder.jpeg"/><br>
                    Here we see Ande trying to catch new ones. He is exhausted.

                <h2>PART III: Betthe</h2>
                <p>
                    <img src="img_placeholder.jpeg"/><br>
                    Betthe collects Shiny Things because they make her happy. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="img_placeholder.jpeg"/><br>
                    There is a quiet jungle in her backyard which she decorates to her liking.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    <img src="img_placeholder.jpeg"/><br>
                    Occasionally she finds that her Shiny Things have been broken and painted red. "Why, if only they weren't broken. I do really like this new colour."
