	<h3> Life, A Sum </h3>
		<p>As I sit here and consider where I want this first assignment to go, I've come to a very reflective place. The past month has been one of transitions, so it seems only appropriate that I consider how my path is currently being shaped by my last two years of experience as an AmeriCorps service member in St. Louis. </p>
	<h3> A Complete Overhaul </h3>
		<p>Can only be...
			<ul><li>Well-informed</li>
			<li>Confusing</li>
			<li>Hapfully considered</li>
			<li>Heartbreaking</li>
			<li>Everything you (and I) need.</li>
		</ul></p>
		<p> My time in STL as an AmeriCorps volunteer was undoubtedly representative of this list. So, now that the term is over, I find need to put down a few thoughts about my service. I found so much fulfillment in new experience but also grieved my old self, put away. These two years truly brought me to a space where I felt the drive to force change where federal, state, institutional, and organizational red tape inhibits and denounces self-advocacy. It's hard for me to move on from everything I've helped build. But, there's always next, which I'm calling:
 		<h3>&amp; What? <em>(WIth some music that inspires me.)</em></h3>
	<p><ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZqxi4wZGkEmpower">Advocacy.</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.chicanobatman.com/">Create.</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdVubZ6fZaULive">Intentionality.</a></li></ul></p></main>
